# UpdateBL - refresh DansGuardian Blacklists
#
# Version: 0.9.2-Lince (Juan J. Prieto <jjprieto@eneotecnologia.com>)
# Date: Oct 29 2002
# Author: Fernand Jonker <fernand@futuragts.com>, based largely on 
# the work of Christopher Rath <christopher@rath.ca>
#
# Updated: Sat 27th December 2003 for new provider
#
# A sysadmin named Mike posted the original script to one of the
# ClarkConnect Forums.  It was then rewritten quite extensively by
# Christopher Rath to make it more configurable and to include error
# checking. Thereafter it was customized by Fernand Jonker for 
# use with DansGuardian.
#
# Copy this script to a convenient location and have cron
# periodically run it to keep your blacklists updated.  Please 
# limit automated downloads to twice or ideally once a week to 
# prevent bandwidth wastage. There is also no point in downloading 
# more often as the lists won't change that much.
#
# Ensure you have wget installed on your server - you can obtain
# it from http://www.wget.org/  
#
# Caveat: when UpdateBL moves the new Blacklists into place it
# only replaces Blacklists; that is, if a new Blacklist is not
# downloaded for a particular category then the old list will
# remain in place.  This is a design feature: to allow you to
# have local Blacklists which are never overwritten/refreshed
# by this script.
#
# Info on Dansguardian and Blacklists can be found at:

# Settings you must configure.  
#	BL_URL - the Blacklist's URL - test file enabled by default.
#		You must change this to the bigblacklist to download the
#		full blacklist file.
#	B_PATH - where the Blacklist database is stored.
#	SG_UGID - the userid and group which must "own" the Blacklist
#		database files (format: "<userid>:<group>)
